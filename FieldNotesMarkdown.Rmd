## What is a field?

*Recommended reading:* Tipler & Mosca 4.2, 21-4

A field is a region of space, where property of that space is
characterized by either a number (a scalar field) or by three numbers (a
vector field).

The concept of a field circumvents the problem of action at a distance
where one inanimate object is "aware\" that another has arrived.

We understand that the first body sets up a field and the second body
interacts with the first via this field. There is no need for action at
a distance because the field of the 1st object is present in space
whether or not the second object is there.

### Charges

Why does object 1 set up a field? Fields arise when objects have charge.
Electric charges cause electromagnetic fields, but other fields arise
from different types of charge for example gravitational fields arise
from mass. (And the strong field that is responsible for holding quarks
inside protons and neutrons arises from the colour charge -- see Inside
The Atom.)

There are two types of **electric charge**, $+$ and $-$. "Like\" charges
repel, while "unlike\" charges attract. Electric charge is quantized:
the **elementary charge** is $1.6021773 \times 10^{-19}$ C and is the
charge on the electron and the proton. Charges measured in laboratories
are always multiples of this but the quarks inside protons and neutrons
and other hadrons have charges that fractions of this elementary charge.
Charge is conserved in all interactions we have observed. Most everyday
objects are electrically neutral with the number of protons and
electrons balanced, which hides the fact that they contain enormous
amounts of $+$ and $-$ charge. Things that we would describe as "charged
objects\", have a small imbalance in charge.

**Gravitational charge:** there is one type of gravitational charge,
which is mass/energy. Gravitational charges attract. We don't know about
quantization of mass. (You can probably spend many hours on the internet
reading different opinions on this). Mass/Energy is conserved and all
everyday objects are gravitationally charged so they all attract each
other but gravity is very weak -- we can easily pick up bits of paper
with an electrically charged rod when rather few electrons have been
moved.

**Strong field charge:** there are three types of fundamental strong
charge (red, green and blue) + three anticharges. Charges attract.
Colour is quantised and colour is conserved in interactions. All
everyday objects are colour neutral. Colour fields are confined within
subatomic particles i.e. to length scales of $\sim 10^{-15}$ m.

## Scalar and vector fields

A scalar field is characterized at each point by a single number. e.g.
the temperature, $T$, at each position in a block of metal heated at
some places and cooled at others.

$T$ is a function of position i.e. $T = T(x,y,z)$. At every point we can
measure the scalar value of the temperature $T$. The black lines
represent isotherms i.e. lines where the temperature is constant
($T_1 < T_2 < T_3 < T_4 < T_5$). Heat flow (blue arrows) is
perpendicular to the contours of constant temperature - the isotherms
($T_1$, $T_2$ etc). The magnitude of the heat flow is proportional to
the temperature gradient so that the heat flow is larger when isotherms
are closer together.

The scalar temperature field has an associated vector field because at
any point, the heat flow is a vector, the **magnitude** and
**direction** of which depend on position. Heat flow is therefore a
vector field which is related to the scalar field of temperature. The
vector gradient of the field of heat flow depends on the temperature at
each point.
